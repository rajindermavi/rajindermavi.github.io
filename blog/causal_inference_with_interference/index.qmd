Classic causal testing typically relies on an assumption of 
no interference between individuals (for example, the SUTVA framework).
With the no-interference assumption, the outcomes of each
individual are unaffected by the treatment of each other individual.


Social media created a need for causal testing theory and methods that flips that assumptions
and conversely handles the case of dense interactions between individuals.
From the perspective of the classical theory there would be no guarantee such methodolody 
would exist, which makes the discoveries of the early social media days a
remarkable story.

Before the advent of the modern theory,

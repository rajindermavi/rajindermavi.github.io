    "section": "",
    "text": "Lately I’ve been exploring research in causal inference. The last 15 years have been a remarkable journey in the topic of causal inference with interference. With the advent of large scale social media platforms there has been enormous interest in understanding causal inference in an environment that permits interactions spanning the entire population under consideration.\nThe goal of causal inference is to understand the causal relationship between an independent and dependent variable. Fundamentally, we would like to understand the impact on the dependent variable \\(Y_i\\) for each individual with a change in the independent variable \\(z = 0,1\\). Mathematically, this is quantified by the Average Treatment Effect \\[\n\\tau(1,0) = \\frac1N\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) \\right)\n\\tag{1}\\] where the difference \\(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\\) represents the change in the dependent variable due to the indepedent variable for the \\(i^{th}\\) unit. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that one can only observe a unit’s response under a single treatment. That is, we can measure \\(Y_i(1)\\) or \\(Y_i(0)\\), but not both. This issue is mitigated in experiments with random assignments of individuals to the control or treatment group. The framework of Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) requires no cross dependence across unit treatments and is the primary historical method for estimation of a single, consistent treatment effect on the dependent variable.\nThe problem of interference within and accross assigment groups of course must immediately be considered unless individuals are completely isolated from one another. Classical approaches to control the interference typically rely on asserting groups of interacting individuals, but no interference between groups. In that case the assignment consideration is taken at a group level (Hudgens and Halloran 2008).\nIn a massively connected component of individuals, there is no hope of assignments of noninteracting groups. Thus interference within the group itself must be controlled. There is an exiting story of the formulation of cluster methods to recover results on treatment effect, that is, the existence of estimators of (Equation 1), and controlling their bias and variance.\nBackground for this note includes the following …\nEnumerate the users \\(\\mathcal{V} = \\{v_1,v_2,...,v_N\\}\\). Typically, the network is modeled as a graph \\(\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})\\). In our example two units may be connected by an edge if they are freinds. For the sake of the experiment, each user is assigned to one of two groups \\(z_i = 0,1\\), with \\(0\\) being the control and \\(1\\) being the treatment.\nWith an assignment of \\(z = (z_1,z_2,..,z_N)\\) the total of the quantity of interest is \\[\nY(z) = \\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i(z)\n\\] where \\(Y_i\\) is the quantity of interest for the \\(i^{th}\\) individual. For our messaging example, \\(Y_i\\) might be the total number of messages the user sent within a two week period. Notice at this point we are allowing that each individual’s behavior depends on the entire assignment vector!\nThe ulimate goal is to estimate \\[\n\\tau(\\vec{1},\\vec{0}) = \\frac1N\\sum_{i=1}^N \\left(Y_i(\\vec{1}) - Y_i(\\vec{0}) \\right)\n\\tag{2}\\] the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). Here \\(\\vec{1}\\) (\\(\\vec{0}\\)) is the assignment of \\(1\\)s (\\(0\\)s) to all individuals. Of course there is no world where we can simultaneously assign all units both 1 and 0, hence the goal of our study.\nIt would be hard to make it very far without making some kind of assumptions on the network effects. How can we make conclusions about \\(\\tau(\\vec{1},\\vec{0})\\) if we can’t isolate the assignment groups? The earliest paper I found in this direction is (Ugander et al. 2013). The authors make the assumption of a net exposure condition which effectively assumes that if sufficiently many agents of an individuals neighborhood belong to a given assignment group, the individual will behave as if the entire network has that assignment. That is, for indivual \\(v\\in\\mathcal{V}\\), suppose there are \\(k_i\\) individuals in \\(A_{1,r}(v)\\) assigned \\(z_j = 1 (0)\\), then we can assume \\(i\\) behaves as if \\(z = \\vec{1} (\\vec{0})\\). Explicit choices of \\(k_i\\) can vary, but the authors consider \\(k_i\\) the size of the neighborhood \\(k_i = |A_{1,r}(v)|\\), or a proportion of the neighborhood \\(k_i = \\kappa |A_{1,r}(v)|\\), or simply a constant minimum over the network \\(k_i = \\kappa\\).\nThe Ugander paper is notable because they tackle the problem of a globally connected network of individuals. Compare this to the more mature literature of estimating the ATE when there are groups of interacting agents (Hudgens and Halloran 2008). In that paper, the population is stratified into groups, and interference is limited to individuals among the same group. For example, a group might be all students in a particular elementary school. The analogy of the net exposure condition, is the assumption that any two assignments of a fixed group are equivalent if they have the same number of individuals assigned to 1 and 0 respectively.\npapers (Hudgens and Halloran 2008), (Aronow and Samii 2017), (Ugander et al. 2013), (Eckles, Karrer, and Ugander 2017)"

In this article we will run through this vetting process.\nLinkedIn has a robust A/B testing methodology developed over years as the world’s leading professional networking site. This 2015 article (Xu et al. 2015) details early scaling solutions. And this (Ivaniuk and Duan 2020b) pair (Ivaniuk and Duan 2020a) of 2020 bog posts lay out their mature infrastructure and methodology for A/B testing, called LinkedIn Targeting, Ramping, and Experimentation platform, or T-REX. All this preparation yields impressive scaling capabilities, supporting 2,000 new experiments per week (as of the 2020 post)."

    "section": "Testing Considerations",
    "text": "Testing Considerations\nThere are a number of considerations to address when designing a test. We’ll break them down into user segmentation and clustering, test conflicts, and timeline.\n\nClustering and Segmentation\nThere are many ways users may be segmented on a social platform like LinkedIn. Consider the many user types on the platform:\n\nJob Seekers/Professionals\nRecruiters\nInfluencers\nSales & Marketing Specialists\nNGO/Nonprofit Workers\nEntrepreneurs/Startups\nCorporate Managers\n\nHowever, natural clusters may not respect these nice categories. Managers and professionals within the same company may be highly networked, whereas professionals in different specialties (Materials Science vs Data Science) may be completely disjoint.\nThe definition of `Natural Clusters’ in this context may not be so straightforward, but any good A/B testing would either assert user independence (IE Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)) or find a methodology to address that issue.\nSince our feature relates to user interactions, it would be wise to consider user clusters as the unit users would be randomized by and assigned treatment groups. This strategy is designed to limit the event of spillover from one treatment group to another. With this approach we must be careful in our estimation of parameters as user selection into treatment groups is affected. Users placed in treatment groups remains a random variable with the same probability distribution, but those random variables are no longer independent of each other.\n\n\n\nConflicts\n\nAlthough LinkedIn allows for overlapping experiments, we would like to avoid intersecting with other experiments on messaging to avoid confounding factors.\nDisjoint:\n\nDirect Messaging Service attributes. EG: DM notifications, look and feel updates, LinkedIn inmail sponsored messages.\n\nIndependent:\n\nNon Direct Messaging Service features. Other notifications, feed updates, etc.\n\nChanging browser types. Every effort should be made to maintain a smooth operating experience between different browsers, however, users switching browsers could be a complicating factor. It could also provide valuable information on which formats provide the best outcomes.\n\n\n\nTimeline\nWe should include a reasonable burn-in period for a novel feature such as this.\nTypical A/B testing cycles run on a timeline of a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 6 - 8 weeks. We will assume a round 8 weeks.\nIdeally we would like to know the impact over a longer timeline. However, for business and experimental control reasons we would like to conclude on a quicker timeline, thus we can use adoption as a proxy on the assumption that memory aids will improve engagements between loosely connected members."

This indicates the user found value for the feature in the past and creates a stickier environment for the user. As we will observe just over the course of several weeks, we will test with a 7 day retention window. \\[\nR = \\frac{\\#\\text{users who used the feature 7 days after their first use.}}{\\#\\text{users who used the feature.}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nA/B testing KPIs:\n\nDirect Messages\n\nAs our feature lives in the direct message service, this would be the primary effect we would like to investigate. \\[\n  M = \\frac{\\#\\text{Direct Messages}}{\\#\\text{Users with context.}}\n  \\]\n\nEngagement\n\nA secondary effect of providing context to peers is a change in engagement, measured in likes, comments, and shares. \\[\n  E = \\frac{\\#\\text{Likes + Comments + Shares}}{\\#\\text{Impressions}}\n  \\]"

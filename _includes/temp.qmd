In a causal experiment we would like to measure 
the impact of a treatment on a quantity of interest.
To fix ideas, suppose we have a social media site and are considering 
an update on the messaging function. 
The goal might be to increase user messaging frequency or even to 
improve the quality of messages as measured by the overall length of each message.
In the classical sense, there is no way to practically isolate users
in a way that would satisfy the SUTVA assumption, 
hence the need to update the theoretical foundations causal experiments are based upon. 


Enumerate the users $\mathcal{V} = \{1,2,...,N\}$.
Typically, the network is modeled as a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$.
In our example two units may be connected by an edge if they are freinds. 
For the sake of the experiment, each user is assigned to one of two groups $z_i = 0,1$, 
with $0$ being the control and $1$ being the treatment.


With an assignment of $z = (z_1,..,z_N)$ the total of the quantity of interest is 
$$
Y(z) = \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i(z)
$$
where $Y_i$ is the quantity of interest for the $i^{th}$ individual.
For our messaging example, $Y_i$ might be the total number of messages 
the user sent within a two week period.
Notice at this point we are allowing that each individual's behavior depends on the 
entire assignment vector!


The ulimate goal is to estimate
$$
\tau(\vec{1},\vec{0}) = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N left(Y_i(\vec{1}) - Y_i(\vec{0}) \right)
$$
the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). 
Here $\vec{1}$ ($\vec{0}$) is the assignment of all $1$s ($0$s).
Of course there is no world where we can simultaneously assign all units both 1 and 0,
hence the goal of our study.


It would be hard to make it very far without making some kind of assumptions on the network effects.
How can we make conclusions about $\tau(\vec{1},\vec{0})$ if we can't isolate the assignment groups?
The earliest paper I found in this direction is [@Ugander2013Graph].
The authors make the assumption of a *net exposure condition* which 
effectively assumes that if sufficiently many agents of an individuals neighborhood belong
to a given assignment group, the individual will behave as if the entire network 
has that assignment.
That is, for indivual $i$, suppose there are $k_i$ individuals in $B_\epsilon(i)^*$ assigned $z_j = 1 (0)$, 
then we can assume $i$ behaves as if $z = \vec{1} (\vec{0})$. 
Explicit choices of $k_i$ can vary, but they consider $k_i = $ 
the size of the neighborhood $|B_\epsilon(i)^*|$, 
or a proportion of the neighborhood $\kappa |B_\epsilon(i)^*|$,
or simply a constant minimum over the network $ \min(\kappa,|B_\epsilon(i)^*|) $.

The Ugander paper is notable because they tackle the problem of a globally connected network of individuals.
Compare this to the more mature literature of estimating the ATE 
when there are groups of interacting agents [\@Hallorhan].

We are almost ready for the analysis now, but there are many directions to go.

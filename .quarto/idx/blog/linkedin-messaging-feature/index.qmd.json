All this preparation yields impressive scaling capabilities, supporting 2,000 new experiments per week.\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\nThere are a number of considerations to address when designing a test. We'll break them down into user segmentation and clustering, test conflicts, and timeline.\n\n### Clustering and Segmentation\n\nSince our feature relates to user interactions, it would be wise to consider user clusters as the unit users would be randomized by and assigned treatment groups. This strategy is designed to limit the event of spillover from one treatment group to another. With this approach we must be careful in our estimation of parameters as user selection into treatment groups is affected. Users placed in treatment groups remains a random variable with the same probability distribution, but those random variables are no longer independent of each other.\n\nConsidering the user base of LinkedIn, we would like to break down users into several categories. \n\n* Job Seekers/Professionals\n* Recruiters\n* Influencers\n* Sales & Marketing Specialists\n* NGO/Nonprofit Workers\n* Entrepreneurs/Startups\n* Corporate Managers\n\nAs this enhancement relates to messaging, I would prefer to select A and B groups composed of well \n\n On top of these segments\n\n### Conflicts\n\n* Although LinkedIn allows for overlapping experiments, we would like to avoid intersecting with other experiments on messaging to avoid confounding factors.\n* Disjoint:\n    + Direct Messaging Service attributes. EG: DM notifications, look and feel updates, LinkedIn inmail sponsored messages.\n* Independent:\n    + Non Direct Messaging Service features. Other notifications, feed updates, etc.\n* Changing browser types. Every effort should be made to maintain a smooth operating experience between different browsers, however, users switching browsers could be a complicating factor. It could also provide valuable information on which formats provide the best outcomes.\n\n### Timeline\n\nWe should include a reasonable burn-in period for a novel feature such as this.\n\nTypical A/B testing cycles run on a timeline of a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 6 - 8 weeks. We will assume a round 8 weeks.\n\nIdeally we would like to know the impact over a longer timeline. However, for business and experimental control reasons we would like to conclude on a quicker timeline, thus we can use adoption as a proxy on the assumption that memory aids will improve engagements between loosely connected members.\n\n\n\n## KPIs and Statistics\n\nNow time for the fun stuff.\n\nThere are many possible KPIs we could utilize for the above aspects we would like to measure. For ease of exposition, we will suggest simple KPIs for each of the above.\n\n#### Utilization KPIs\n\n\n* Adoption.\n    - Tracking users who use the feature when it becomes available to them, a higher adoption rate suggests more users find it relevant.\n\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\#\\text{users who used the feature at least once}}{\\#\\text{users exposed to the feature}}\n$$\n* Frequency.\n    - Measure total number of uses over the course of the trial. Higher frequency of use implies each user finds value in the feature over many connections.\nAs use of the feature is dependent on entering the messaging window, an opportunity would be defined as entering a messaging window where the summary is not yet filled in.\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\#\\text{ times feature is used.}}{\\#\\text{opportunities to use the feature.}}\n$$\n\n\n* Retention.\n    - Check that users return to the feature over a specified time span. This indicates the user found value for the feature in the past and creates a stickier environment for the user. \nAs we will observe just over the course of several weeks, we will test with a 7 day retention window.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\#\\text{users who used the feature 7 days after their first use.}}{\\#\\text{users who used the feature.}}\n$$\n\n\n#### A/B testing KPIs:\n\n* Direct Messages\n    - As our feature lives in the direct message service, this would be the primary effect we would like to investigate.\n    $$\n    M = \\frac{\\#\\text{Direct Messages}}{\\#\\text{Users with context.}}\n    $$\n* Engagement\n    - A secondary effect of providing context to peers is a change in engagement, measured in likes, comments, and shares.\n    $$\n    E = \\frac{\\#\\text{Likes + Comments + Shares}}{\\#\\text{Impressions}}\n    $$\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](LinkedInGraph.png){ .header-image width=25% }\n\n\nLet's talk about A/B testing.\n\nSpecifically, we'll consider an enhancement to their direct messaging service.

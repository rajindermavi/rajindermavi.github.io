All this preparation yields impressive scaling capabilities, supporting 2,000 new experiments per week.\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\nPrimarily we would like to know if our feature provides a better experience and encourages users to engage more with the site. Let's examine this more closely.\n\n### Timeline\n\nWe should include a reasonable burn-in period for a novel feature such as this.\n\nTypical A/B testing cycles run on a timeline of a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 6 - 8 weeks. \n\nIdeally we would like to know the impact over a longer timeline. However, for business and experimental control reasons we would like to conclude on a quicker timeline, thus we can use adoption as a proxy on the assumption that memory aids will improve engagements between loosely connected members.\n\n### Multiple Testing\n\n* First Order\n    + Utilization\n        - Adoption. Frequency. Retention.\n        - Do users interact with the tool? How often? Consistently over the course of the trial?\n    + Direct Messages\n        - Does the feature lead to higher DM rates between users?\n* Second Order\n    + Visiting Profiles\n* Third Order\n    + Engagement\n\n### Segmenting\nConsidering the user base of LinkedIn, we would like to break down users into several categories. \n\n* Job Seekers/Professionals\n* Recruiters\n* Influencers\n* Sales & Marketing Specialists\n* NGO/Nonprofit Workers\n* Entrepreneurs/Startups\n* Corporate Managers\n\nAs this enhancement relates to messaging, I would prefer to select A and B groups composed of well \n\n On top of these segments\n\n### Conflicts\n\n* Although LinkedIn allows for overlapping experiments, we would like to avoid intersecting with other experiments on messaging to avoid confounding factors.\n* Disjoint:\n    + Messaging app properties: look and feel, fields layout, button placement\n* Independent:\n    + Message notifications, alerts, etc\n* Changing browser types. Every effort should be made to maintain a smooth operating experience between different browsers, however, users switching browsers could be a complicating factor. It could also provide valuable information on which formats provide the best outcomes.\n\n## KPIs and Statistics\n\nNow time for the fun stuff.\n\nThere are many possible KPIs we could utilize for the above aspects we would like to measure. For the sake of simplicity, we will suggest one KPI for each of the above.\n\n### KPIs\n\n#### First Order KPIs:\n\nAdoption Rate:\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\text{# users who used the feature at least once}}{\\text{# users exposed to the feature}} \n$$\n\nFrequency:\nAs use of the feature is dependent on entering the messaging window, an opportunity would be defined as entering a messaging window where the summary is not yet filled in.\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\text{# times feature is used.}}{\\text{# Opportunities to use the feature.}}\n$$\n\nRetention:\nFor simplicity here let's focus on retention over a fixed time period.
